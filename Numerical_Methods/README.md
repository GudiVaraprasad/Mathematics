# Objectives :
1.	The aim of this repo is to cover certain basic, important computer oriented numerical methods for analysing problems that arise in engineering and physical sciences. 
2.	I used MATLAB as the primary computer language to obtain solutions to a few problems.


# Expected outcomes :
1.	To appreciate the power of numerical methods and use them to analyse the problems connected with data analysis, and solution of ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in their respective engineering courses.
2.	To understand the processes of numerical simulation, modeling, optimization, identification, and visualization of engineering systems.
